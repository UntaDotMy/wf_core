# Experience Briefs, Brownfield Redesign, and Validation Loops

Use this reference when a UX task needs sharper framing, safer redesign boundaries, or stronger connection between journey-level research and component-level validation.

## Experience Brief

Capture these fields before recommending changes:

1. Target user and job-to-be-done
2. Trigger and context of use
3. Primary journey and critical decision points
4. Known friction, confusion, abandonment, or trust risks
5. Current evidence: analytics, support tickets, session review, usability findings, stakeholder constraints
6. Success metrics and failure signals
7. Brownfield constraints: established brand rules, regulatory limits, technical dependencies, release sensitivity

If the request references a familiar product family, also capture:

8. Which familiar behaviors must stay recognizable to existing users
9. Which part of the journey actually feels broken enough to justify redesign
10. Which interruption and recovery risks matter most, such as drafts, retries, presence, or attachment state in messaging flows

## Brownfield Redesign Rules

- Preserve mental models users already rely on unless evidence shows they are harmful.
- Change the smallest part of the journey that can plausibly solve the problem.
- Name what stays stable versus what changes.
- Pair the redesign with a validation plan before rollout.

Useful persistent artifacts:

- `docs/design-system/MASTER.md` for product-wide experience and UI rules
- `docs/design-system/pages/<slug>.md` for local journey or page overrides
- `docs/research/<topic>.md` for evidence summaries and next-step decisions

Write-safety rules:

- derive a safe fallback slug when optional names are missing
- create directories before writing
- avoid implicit crashes or silent failures when metadata is absent

## Validation Loops

Use the lightest effective validation:

- usability check for comprehension and task success
- experiment or metric guard for production impact
- Storybook, Ladle, Histoire, or equivalent if component behavior is part of the UX risk
- design artifacts such as Pencil or Figma as supporting inputs, not the only evidence source

Tie every validation step back to a real outcome:

- completion rate
- confidence and trust
- recovery from errors
- decision speed
- accessibility and comprehension
