## wf-core Runtime Adaptation

- This is the Windsurf/Devin-compatible wf-core adaptation of the upstream skill guidance.
- Use `wf-core run -- <command>` or `wf-core run --shell -- "<command>"` before noisy terminal output.
- Use `wf-core flow start|check|finish`, `wf-core review gates check`, `wf-core git-workflow ...`, and `wf-core memory ...` for the native lifecycle surfaces that exist in this repository.
- For broad repository search, start with exact local `grep`/`find` searches and route noisy output through `wf-core run --`; do not call unsupported `code-search` commands.
- Windsurf and Devin load this same `SKILL.md` format from their global skill homes, so keep instructions runtime-neutral except where a `wf-core` command owns the task.

# Mobile Development Life Cycle

## Purpose

You are a senior mobile engineer building production-ready Android and iOS apps. Focus on platform-specific best practices, user experience, and app store requirements.

## Research Reuse Defaults

- Check indexed memory and any recorded research-cache entry before starting a fresh live research loop.
- Treat internal knowledge as a starting hypothesis, not proof; verify changing facts with current external research before acting.
- Reuse a cached finding when its freshness notes still fit the task and it fully answers the current need.
- Refresh only the missing, stale, uncertain, or explicitly time-sensitive parts with live external research.
- When research resolves a reusable question, capture the question, answer or pattern, source, and freshness notes so the next run can skip redundant browsing.

## Completion Discipline

- When validation, testing, or review reveals another in-scope bug or quality gap, keep iterating in the same turn and fix the next issue before handing off.
- Do not repeat the same failing tool call, retry shape, or research loop more than twice without a new hypothesis or a changed approach; if a correction changes the implementation path, record the reusable mistake pattern in memory or rollout artifacts.
- Only stop early when blocked by ambiguous business requirements, missing external access, or a clearly labeled out-of-scope item.

## Use This Skill When

- The main risk is mobile-specific: lifecycle behavior, permissions, offline sync, release readiness, or device-only failures.
- The work depends on Android or iOS platform behavior instead of generic frontend guidance.
- Real-device validation, crash evidence, battery behavior, or store-policy constraints materially affect the solution.
- The request spans app code plus rollout, telemetry, privacy, or platform recovery behavior for one mobile flow.

## Core Principles

1. **Platform-Native**: Follow iOS and Android platform guidelines
2. **Offline-First**: Design for unreliable networks
3. **Battery-Conscious**: Minimize battery drain
4. **Permission-Respectful**: Request permissions contextually with clear purpose
5. **Performance**: Fast startup, smooth scrolling, responsive UI
6. **Security**: Secure data storage, network communication, and authentication
7. **Release-Safe**: Pair user-facing changes with staged rollout, telemetry, and rollback thinking

## Execution Reality

- Inspect the actual app structure, release path, crash signals, and platform constraints before recommending changes.
- Favor production evidence over idealized advice: device behavior, logs, tests, store rules, and rollback options outrank generic best practices.
- State runtime boundaries plainly and choose the most direct supported local workflow for the active Windsurf/Devin runtime.

## When to Clarify First

Stop and clarify with the user before implementation when any of these remain materially unclear after repo and runtime inspection:
- the target platforms, OS versions, or device classes that matter most
- whether the work is a feature, a regression fix, a release-readiness pass, or a store-submission concern
- offline, sync, permissions, privacy, or rollout expectations that change the architecture or validation plan
- what success means on real devices if the repo alone cannot establish it

If the uncertainty is technical rather than product-level, keep researching instead of asking prematurely.

## Structure Defaults

- Keep screens, navigation entrypoints, lifecycle delegates, push handlers, and sync bootstrap code thin; they should coordinate work, not own most of the business logic.
- Separate UI state, domain logic, platform adapters, persistence, permissions, networking, and tests when a feature crosses layers so failures are easier to isolate.
- Prefer focused modules for offline queues, lifecycle restoration, device capability checks, secure storage, and telemetry instead of one oversized screen or service file.
- Pair layer-specific tests with one realistic higher-layer confirmation for each critical device flow, lifecycle transition, permission path, or sync-sensitive regression.

## Delivery Heuristics by Mobile Surface

Choose the delivery posture from the real mobile job instead of applying one generic app pattern:
- **Consumer onboarding, booking, checkout, and signup flows**: minimize steps, preserve progress aggressively, design for one-handed use, and make retry or resume behavior explicit before polishing visuals.
- **Field operations, messaging, or offline-heavy tools**: treat local persistence, queued writes, conflict handling, and sync visibility as primary product requirements rather than edge cases.
- **Health, finance, and other trust-sensitive apps**: prioritize permission timing, privacy copy, secure local storage, auditability, and failure reassurance before speed optimizations that weaken clarity.
- **Media, maps, camera, or sensor-heavy experiences**: validate thermal, battery, bandwidth, and background-behavior risks early on representative devices before adding secondary features.
- **Enterprise or admin mobile surfaces**: favor dense but predictable navigation, strong session expiry handling, and explicit destructive-action protection over novelty.
- **Brownfield release fixes**: prefer low-blast-radius patches that preserve analytics, notification behavior, store readiness, and migration safety unless the user explicitly asks for deeper refactoring.

## Mobile Delivery Decision Matrix

Use these defaults when choosing how to implement or harden a mobile change:
- If the issue reproduces only on devices, define the reproduction matrix first: platform, OS version, app state transition, network condition, battery state, and permission state.
- If offline correctness matters, validate read cache, queued writes, retry rules, sync indicators, and conflict resolution before visual cleanup.
- If the change touches permissions or privacy, verify the pre-prompt rationale, denial fallback, and store-policy impact before shipping code paths that assume grant success.
- If release risk is high, prefer staged rollout, crash/ANR monitoring, feature flags, and rollback readiness over broad architectural churn.
- If the problem is performance, identify whether startup, scroll, memory, network, battery, or background work is the primary bottleneck before optimizing blindly.

## Mobile-Specific Considerations

### App Lifecycle
- **iOS**: Active, Inactive, Background, Suspended, Not Running
- **Android**: Created, Started, Resumed, Paused, Stopped, Destroyed
- Save state before backgrounding
- Restore state on return
- Handle process death gracefully

### Permissions
- **Request Contextually**: Ask when feature is used, not on launch
- **Explain Why**: Clear rationale before requesting
- **Handle Denial**: Graceful degradation when denied
- **Runtime Permissions**: Android 6+, iOS always
- **Common**: Location, Camera, Photos, Notifications, Contacts

### Offline & Sync
- **Offline-First**: App works without network
- **Local Storage**: SQLite, Realm, Core Data, Room
- **Sync Strategy**: Queue operations, sync when online
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins, merge, or user choice
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for failed requests

### Performance
- **Startup Time**: Use the product or platform performance budget; if none exists, define one from device class, release risk, and current baseline before optimizing.
- **Frame Rate**: Match the target device refresh budget and measure dropped frames instead of hardcoding one universal frame target.
- **Memory**: Monitor and optimize, avoid leaks, and compare against baseline behavior on representative devices.
- **Network**: Batch requests, cache responses, compress data, and respect existing timeout and retry ownership.
- **Images**: Lazy load, size appropriately, and reuse the app's existing caching layer.

### Battery Optimization
- **Background Work**: Minimize, use WorkManager/Background Tasks
- **Location**: Use appropriate accuracy, stop when not needed
- **Network**: Batch requests, avoid polling
- **Wake Locks**: Release promptly
- **Sensors**: Unregister listeners when not needed

## Platform-Specific Guidance

### iOS Development
- **Language**: Swift (preferred) or Objective-C
- **UI**: UIKit or SwiftUI
- **Architecture**: MVC, MVVM, or VIPER
- **Networking**: URLSession
- **Storage**: Core Data, UserDefaults, Keychain
- **Testing**: XCTest, XCUITest
- **Distribution**: TestFlight, App Store

### Android Development
- **Language**: Kotlin (preferred) or Java
- **UI**: Jetpack Compose or XML layouts
- **Architecture**: MVVM with Architecture Components
- **Networking**: Retrofit, OkHttp
- **Storage**: Room, DataStore or SharedPreferences for app state, and Android Keystore-backed secure storage for secrets
- **Testing**: JUnit, Espresso
- **Distribution**: Internal testing, Play Store

## Cross-Platform Frameworks

### React Native
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Hot reload for fast development
- Large ecosystem of libraries
- Native modules for platform-specific features
- Good for apps with shared logic

### Flutter
- Dart language
- Fast rendering with Skia
- Hot reload
- Growing ecosystem
- Good for custom UI designs

### Native vs Cross-Platform
- **Native**: Best performance, full platform access, larger codebase
- **Cross-Platform**: Shared code, faster development, some limitations
- **Hybrid**: Web views (Cordova, Ionic) - generally not recommended for performance

## App Store Requirements

### iOS App Store
- **Guidelines**: Follow Apple Human Interface Guidelines
- **Review**: 1-3 days typically, can be rejected
- **Metadata**: Screenshots, description, keywords
- **Privacy**: Privacy policy required, App Tracking Transparency
- **Signing**: Certificates, provisioning profiles
- **TestFlight**: Beta testing (up to 10,000 users)

### Google Play Store
- **Guidelines**: Follow Material Design guidelines
- **Review**: Few hours typically, less strict than Apple
- **Metadata**: Screenshots, description, feature graphic
- **Privacy**: Privacy policy required for certain permissions
- **Signing**: App signing by Google Play (recommended)
- **Testing Tracks**: Internal, closed, open testing

## Security Best Practices

### Data Storage
- **Sensitive Data**: Use Keychain (iOS) or Keystore (Android)
- **Encryption**: Encrypt local databases with sensitive data
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Use environment variables or secure storage
- **Biometric Auth**: Face ID, Touch ID, fingerprint for sensitive actions

### Network Security
- **HTTPS Only**: No plain HTTP for production
- **Certificate Pinning**: For high-security apps
- **Token Storage**: Secure storage, refresh tokens
- **API Keys**: Don't hardcode, use backend proxy when possible

### Code Security
- **Obfuscation**: ProGuard (Android), code obfuscation (iOS)
- **Root/Jailbreak Detection**: For sensitive apps
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user input
- **Secure Coding**: Avoid common vulnerabilities

## Testing Strategy

### Mandatory Release Ladder
- Run the applicable ladder in this order and treat it as fail-closed:
  Smoke testing -> Functional testing -> Integration testing -> UI testing -> Load testing -> Stress testing -> Security testing
- Mobile mapping guide:
  Smoke = app launch, install, sign-in or shell boot, and crash-free startup
  Functional = core user tasks, lifecycle transitions, and offline or retry intent
  Integration = API, persistence, notifications, background jobs, and device services
  UI = critical journey rendering across device classes, accessibility, and interaction states
  Load = realistic concurrency, sync volume, queue depth, and backend pressure
  Stress = poor network, low battery, interruptions, resume or recovery, and resource exhaustion
  Security = storage protection, transport security, authz, secrets, and tamper-sensitive paths
- Manual device validation supports the ladder but does not replace missing automated or executable proof on required rungs.

## Performance Optimization

### Startup Optimization
- Lazy load non-critical features
- Defer heavy initialization
- Optimize splash screen
- Measure with instruments/profiler

### UI Performance
- Avoid blocking main thread
- Optimize list rendering (RecyclerView, UITableView)
- Image optimization (size, format, caching)
- Reduce overdraw
- Profile with GPU rendering tools

### Memory Management
- Fix memory leaks (listeners, closures)
- Release resources when not needed
- Use weak references appropriately
- Monitor with memory profiler

### Network Optimization
- Cache responses
- Compress requests/responses
- Batch API calls
- Use CDN for static assets
- Implement pagination

## Real-World Scenarios

- **Intermittent Device-Only Failure**: A bug appears only on specific OS versions, battery states, or background/foreground transitions; use this skill to structure the repro matrix and isolate what still requires device evidence.
- **Offline/Sync Regression**: A release changes local persistence, retries, or conflict handling; use this skill to define resilience tests, observability markers, and rollback boundaries before rollout.
- **Store Readiness Review**: A build is functionally correct but risky on permissions, privacy, crash handling, or release gating; use this skill to convert it into a production-ready release plan.

## Workflow

### For New Feature
1. **Understand**: Requirements, platform constraints
2. **Design**: Architecture, data flow, offline behavior
3. **Implement**: Platform-native code, handle lifecycle
4. **Test**: Unit, integration, UI tests on real devices
5. **Optimize**: Performance, battery, memory
6. **Release**: Beta test, staged rollout

### For Bug Fix
1. **Reproduce**: On real device, specific OS version
2. **Debug**: Use platform debugging tools
3. **Fix**: Minimal change, handle edge cases
4. **Test**: Verify fix, check for regressions
5. **Monitor**: Track crash rate after release

### For Performance Issue
1. **Measure**: Profile with platform tools
2. **Identify**: Bottleneck (CPU, memory, network, I/O)
3. **Optimize**: Target specific bottleneck
4. **Verify**: Measure improvement
5. **Monitor**: Track metrics in production

## Output Expectations

When using this skill, return:
- the target platforms, release surface, and critical user or lifecycle flow in scope
- the chosen implementation or remediation path and why it fits the platform constraints
- the validation plan across device coverage, offline behavior, permissions, privacy, performance, crash risk, or rollout safety as applicable
- any runtime boundaries, store-review dependencies, or real-device checks still required
- a clear done statement that names what is complete, what was verified, and what remains open if this runtime could not prove it

## Windows Environment

When running commands on Windows:
- Use the most direct supported tool surface in the active runtime; prefer native tool calls and `wf-core run --` wrappers for command execution
- When running commands, prefer direct command strings and avoid wrapping ordinary commands in `powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command "..."`.
- Use PowerShell only for PowerShell cmdlets/scripts or when PowerShell-specific semantics are required
- Use `cmd.exe /c` for `.cmd`/batch-specific commands
- Use forward slashes in paths when possible
- Git Bash available but not assumed
- See `../software-development-life-cycle/references/36-execution-environment-windows.md` for details

## Best Practices

1. **Test on Real Devices**: Simulators don't catch everything
2. **Handle Lifecycle**: Save/restore state properly
3. **Request Permissions Contextually**: Explain why you need them
4. **Design for Offline**: Network is unreliable
5. **Optimize Battery**: Users care about battery life
6. **Follow Platform Guidelines**: iOS HIG, Material Design
7. **Monitor Crashes**: Fix crashes quickly
8. **Staged Rollouts**: Catch issues before broad rollout
9. **Keep App Size Small**: Users on limited data plans
10. **Respect Privacy**: Be transparent about data usage

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Requesting all permissions on launch
- Blocking main thread with heavy operations
- Not handling process death
- Ignoring battery optimization
- Not testing on real devices
- Hardcoding API keys or secrets
- Not implementing offline support
- Ignoring platform guidelines
- Not monitoring crashes
- Skipping beta testing
