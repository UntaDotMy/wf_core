# Merge Conflict Resolution

## Understanding Merge Conflicts

### What is a Merge Conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically resolve differences between two commits. This happens when:
- Two branches modify the same line in a file
- One branch deletes a file while another modifies it
- Two branches create files with the same name

### When Do Conflicts Occur?

**During Merge:**
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
# CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.txt
```

**During Rebase:**
```bash
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
# CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.txt
```

**During Cherry-Pick:**
```bash
git cherry-pick abc123
# CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.txt
```

**During Pull:**
```bash
git pull origin main
# CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.txt
```

## Merge vs Rebase: When to Use What

### Merge

**What it does:**
- Creates a merge commit
- Preserves complete history
- Shows when branches were merged

**When to use:**
- Merging feature branches into main
- Integrating changes from main into feature branch
- When history preservation is important
- When working on shared branches

**Pros:**
- Safe (non-destructive)
- Preserves context
- Easy to understand

**Cons:**
- Creates merge commits (cluttered history)
- Non-linear history

**Example:**
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
```

**Result:**
```
*   Merge branch 'feature-branch' into main
|\
| * Feature commit 2
| * Feature commit 1
* | Main commit 2
* | Main commit 1
|/
* Common ancestor
```

### Rebase

**What it does:**
- Replays commits on top of another branch
- Rewrites history
- Creates linear history

**When to use:**
- Updating feature branch with latest main
- Cleaning up local commits before pushing
- When linear history is preferred
- **NEVER on shared/public branches**

**Pros:**
- Clean, linear history
- Easier to follow
- No merge commits

**Cons:**
- Rewrites history (dangerous on shared branches)
- Can lose context
- More complex conflict resolution

**Example:**
```bash
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
```

**Result:**
```
* Feature commit 2 (rebased)
* Feature commit 1 (rebased)
* Main commit 2
* Main commit 1
* Common ancestor
```

### Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Use Merge | Use Rebase |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| Integrating feature into main | OK |  |
| Updating feature with latest main | OK | OK |
| Cleaning up local commits |  | OK |
| Working on shared branch | OK |  |
| Working on private branch | OK | OK |
| Want to preserve history | OK |  |
| Want linear history |  | OK |

**Golden Rule:** Never rebase commits that have been pushed to a shared branch.

## Identifying Conflicts

### Check Status

```bash
git status
```

**Output:**
```
On branch main
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
  (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
        both modified:   src/app.js
        both modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit
```

### View Conflicted Files

```bash
# List conflicted files
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U

# Show conflicts
git diff
```

## Conflict Markers

### Understanding the Markers

```javascript
// <<<<<<< HEAD (Current Change)
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
// =======
const greeting = "Hi there!";
// >>>>>>> feature-branch (Incoming Change)
```

**Breakdown:**
- `<<<<<<< HEAD`: Start of your changes (current branch)
- `=======`: Separator between changes
- `>>>>>>> feature-branch`: End of incoming changes (other branch)

### Multiple Conflicts in Same File

```javascript
// Conflict 1
// <<<<<<< HEAD
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
// =======
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
// >>>>>>> feature-branch

// Conflict 2
// <<<<<<< HEAD
const result = add(2, 3);
// =======
const result = sum(2, 3);
// >>>>>>> feature-branch
```

## Resolving Conflicts

### Manual Resolution

**1. Open the conflicted file**

**2. Choose which changes to keep:**

**Option A: Keep your changes (HEAD)**
```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
```

**Option B: Keep their changes (incoming)**
```javascript
const greeting = "Hi there!";
```

**Option C: Keep both (combine)**
```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
const alternativeGreeting = "Hi there!";
```

**Option D: Write new solution**
```javascript
const greeting = "Hello there, World!";
```

**3. Remove conflict markers**

Remove `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` lines.

**4. Stage the resolved file**
```bash
git add src/app.js
```

**5. Continue the merge/rebase**
```bash
# For merge
git commit

# For rebase
git rebase --continue
```

### Using Git Commands

**Accept yours (current branch):**
```bash
git checkout --ours src/app.js
git add src/app.js
```

**Accept theirs (incoming branch):**
```bash
git checkout --theirs src/app.js
git add src/app.js
```

**Note:** `--ours` and `--theirs` are swapped during rebase!

### Using Merge Tools

**Configure merge tool:**
```bash
# VS Code
git config --global merge.tool vscode
git config --global mergetool.vscode.cmd 'code --wait $MERGED'

# Vim
git config --global merge.tool vimdiff

# Meld (GUI)
git config --global merge.tool meld
```

**Launch merge tool:**
```bash
git mergetool
```

**VS Code Merge Editor:**
- Shows 3-way diff (yours, theirs, result)
- Click "Accept Current Change" or "Accept Incoming Change"
- Or manually edit the result
- Save and close

## Conflict Resolution Strategies

### Strategy 1: Accept All Yours

```bash
# Accept all conflicts from current branch
git merge -X ours feature-branch

# Or during conflict
git checkout --ours .
git add .
git commit
```

### Strategy 2: Accept All Theirs

```bash
# Accept all conflicts from incoming branch
git merge -X theirs feature-branch

# Or during conflict
git checkout --theirs .
git add .
git commit
```

### Strategy 3: Manual Review (Recommended)

Review each conflict individually and make informed decisions.

### Strategy 4: Abort and Retry

```bash
# Abort merge
git merge --abort

# Abort rebase
git rebase --abort

# Abort cherry-pick
git cherry-pick --abort
```

## Complex Conflict Scenarios

### Scenario 1: File Deleted in One Branch, Modified in Another

**Conflict:**
```
CONFLICT (modify/delete): file.txt deleted in HEAD and modified in feature-branch
```

**Resolution:**
```bash
# Keep the file (modified version)
git add file.txt

# Delete the file
git rm file.txt

# Then continue
git commit
```

### Scenario 2: File Renamed in One Branch, Modified in Another

**Conflict:**
```
CONFLICT (rename/modify): file.txt renamed to newfile.txt in HEAD and modified in feature-branch
```

**Resolution:**
```bash
# Git usually handles this automatically
# If not, manually resolve and stage
git add newfile.txt
git commit
```

### Scenario 3: Binary File Conflicts

**Problem:** Can't merge binary files (images, PDFs, etc.)

**Resolution:**
```bash
# Choose one version
git checkout --ours image.png
# or
git checkout --theirs image.png

git add image.png
git commit
```

### Scenario 4: Multiple Conflicts Across Many Files

**Strategy:**
1. Resolve one file at a time
2. Test after each resolution
3. Stage resolved files incrementally
4. Use `git status` frequently

```bash
# Resolve file1.js
git add file1.js

# Resolve file2.js
git add file2.js

# Check remaining conflicts
git status

# Continue when all resolved
git commit
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Communicate with Team

Before resolving conflicts:
- Understand why the conflict occurred
- Talk to the person who made the conflicting changes
- Agree on the resolution approach

### 2. Test After Resolution

```bash
# After resolving conflicts
npm test
npm run build

# Ensure everything works
```

### 3. Keep Commits Small

Smaller commits = fewer conflicts

### 4. Pull/Rebase Frequently

```bash
# Update your branch regularly
git pull origin main
# or
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

### 5. Use Feature Branches

- Keep main stable
- Work on feature branches
- Merge when ready

### 6. Review Conflicts Carefully

Don't blindly accept one side. Understand the changes.

### 7. Use .gitattributes for Merge Strategies

```
# .gitattributes
package-lock.json merge=ours
yarn.lock merge=ours
```

## Preventing Conflicts

### 1. Coordinate with Team

- Communicate about what you're working on
- Avoid working on the same files simultaneously
- Use code ownership (CODEOWNERS file)

### 2. Modularize Code

- Small, focused files
- Clear module boundaries
- Reduce coupling

### 3. Pull Before Push

```bash
git pull origin main
# Resolve any conflicts
git push origin main
```

### 4. Use Linting and Formatting

- Consistent code style prevents formatting conflicts
- Use Prettier, ESLint, etc.
- Configure in .editorconfig

### 5. Rebase Feature Branches Regularly

```bash
# Keep feature branch up to date
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
```

## When to Ask for Help

**Ask for help when:**
- Conflict involves critical business logic
- You don't understand the conflicting changes
- Conflict affects many files
- You're unsure which version is correct
- Conflict involves code you didn't write

**How to ask:**
- Describe the conflict clearly
- Show the conflicting code
- Explain what you're trying to achieve
- Ask the original author if possible

## Troubleshooting

### Conflict Markers Still Present After Resolution

**Problem:** Forgot to remove `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` markers

**Solution:**
```bash
# Search for conflict markers
grep -r "<<<<<<< HEAD" .
grep -r "=======" .
grep -r ">>>>>>>" .

# Remove them manually
```

### Accidentally Committed Conflict Markers

**Problem:** Committed file with conflict markers

**Solution:**
```bash
# Fix the file
# Remove conflict markers

# Amend the commit (if not pushed)
git add file.txt
git commit --amend

# Or create a new commit (if pushed)
git add file.txt
git commit -m "Fix: Remove conflict markers"
```

### Lost Changes During Conflict Resolution

**Problem:** Accidentally deleted important changes

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check reflog
git reflog

# Find the commit before conflict
git show HEAD@{1}

# Restore if needed
git reset --hard HEAD@{1}
```

### Merge/Rebase Taking Too Long

**Problem:** Too many conflicts, getting overwhelmed

**Solution:**
```bash
# Abort and try a different approach
git merge --abort
# or
git rebase --abort

# Try merging instead of rebasing
# Or break into smaller merges
```
