## Quick Review Sequence

1. Confirm scope and requirements baseline.
2. Run risk-focused checks by severity.
3. Validate understanding/reasoning discipline (problem re-read, approach rationale, pseudocode/outline, and test-debug evidence).
4. Validate code-integrity anti-patterns with the dedicated anti-pattern reference.
5. Validate hook-safety gate (top-level hook order, interactive state-transition checks, and bundle-patch static guards when applicable).
6. Validate API/database/formatting guidance with current authoritative sources.
7. Validate dependencies and advisories with current sources.
8. Validate source evidence quality (links + checked-on date) for time-sensitive claims.
9. Validate research reuse decision and freshness-window fit (reuse vs fresh lookup with rationale).
10. If initial research was generic, validate refinement rounds and final specificity.
11. Validate verified-fix memory capture status (or explicit manual capture note when unavailable).
12. Validate .gitignore/secret-hygiene controls and tracked-file exposure risks.
13. Validate testing and release-readiness evidence.
14. Validate regression-prevention evidence coverage and gate status before verdict.
15. Validate commit payload cleanliness (no secrets or local artifacts; includes necessary tests) with evidence (git status --porcelain, git diff --cached --name-only).
16. Validate context re-read discipline for user story and relevant files/folders before actions.
17. Validate file read-refresh discipline for all modified files (read-before-write and re-read-after-change).
18. Validate post-modification reviewer trigger evidence (review run and re-run are aligned to latest modified state).
19. Validate post-implementation code quality/readability gate (clean readable code, no shortform shortcuts, no duplication, robust minimal maintainable design, and @param coverage).
20. Validate deliberate action/tooling evidence (think-first note, expected outcome, and fallback per non-trivial action).
21. Validate resolved-error learning capture (error fingerprint, root cause, resolution evidence, and memory capture or manual note).
23. Validate low-reasoning exploration quorum evidence (minimum two low-effort streams plus synthesis consensus) when low exploration is used.
24. Validate medium-reasoning dual-stream synthesis evidence (exactly two medium-effort streams, min 2 max 2, plus synthesized output) when medium analysis/context/review streams are used.
25. Validate final-reviewer role binding evidence (reviewer role used for final review, not default).
26. Validate runtime tool bridge-tools-only compliance for agents (tool calls through the active runtime tool bridge when applicable).
27. Validate strict code-quality zero-tolerance handling (no unresolved small code-quality mistakes in strict categories).
28. Validate anti-hallucination recovery harness evidence when uncertainty occurred (detect -> re-read -> reproduce -> re-research -> retry -> re-validate).
29. Validate summary-first handoff quality (compact packet used and no raw full-prompt/history replay).
30. Validate role-output discipline (non-reviewer concise packets; reviewer full narrative output).
31. Validate structure/style continuity and variable naming clarity against existing project conventions.
32. Validate dark/light theme parity and CTA/button visibility when UI is in scope.
33. Validate shared component/token propagation safety for global UI changes.
34. Validate hardcoded-value elimination and fallback necessity (clarification-first when fallback behavior is ambiguous).
35. Validate execution strategy and session stability (sequential vs optional parallel, single-writer discipline, and checkpointed steps).
36. Validate pre-execution brainstorm/voting loop quality when applicable (proposals, rubric scoring, tie handling, no-surprise scope check).
37. Validate runtime feature-state gate handling (`wf-core status`, runtime config, and capability-dependent fallback decisions).
38. Validate runtime tool bridge timeout/reset stability handling when such a bridge is used (timeout_ms pragmas, chunking, and recovery evidence).
39. Validate domain-first routing quality (clear specialist ownership + reviewer only when needed for audits or final validation).
40. Validate flow-quality dimension alignment when process quality is in scope.
41. Validate skill expertise depth and vague-prompt handling quality (for skill reviews).
42. Return actionable feedback and readiness verdict.
